## The BRD

This BRD is designed to outline the needs and wants for the Copernican
Sky project created by Newhome Studio. This document is outlined to show
what items are must-haves, typed in GREEN are as well as items that are
wants, but are unnecessary, typed in RED. This document also includes
items that are undecided yet as they are not certainly wanted or needed,
and have been coded with the colour ORANGE. Please read on and keep this
legend in mind.

Combat

Attributes:

> Primary Attributes
>
> Primary attributes are the scaling statistic of this ASRPG. These
> attributes are what scale the items of the game, which will determine
> how an enemy is defeated. If I have a good Skill weapon for instance,
> that weapon will do more to damage to the opponent’s constitution.
>
> Skill – This stat is the primary attribute for some items. This Stat
> also affects your chance to parry a blow when correctly blocking,
> turning the initiative, can be increased by Attribute Mastery
>
> Strength – This stat is the primary attribute for some items. This
> stat also affects your chance to Mutilate and thus end the battle
> decisively, can be increased by Attribute Mastery

Secondary Attributes

> Speed – The speed stat shrinks the timing window, giving them less
> time to react while on the offensive. Small chance after a successful
> hit to strike again, dealing double damage, can be increased by
> Attribute Mastery.
>
> Reaction – The reaction stat enlarges the timing window, giving you
> more time to react while on the defensive. Small chance to go into a
> trance that greatly enlarging the timing window, can be increased by
> Attribute Mastery
>
> Initiative – The skill that influences whether or not you are on
> offence or defence at the beginning of a fight. There is a very small
> chance when winning initiative that your opponent cannot react and the
> first timing window and the user achieves a free attack, can be
> achieved by attribute mastery.
>
> Constitution – The Constitution attribute decides how much punishment
> you can take before your character loses a fight. There is a small
> chance when taking lethal damage that you are able to hang on, one hit
> away from death, and continue fighting. This can occur only once or
> with Mastery, twice in a fight.
>
> Tertiary Attributes
>
> Armour – Can only be increased via items worn, reduces incoming damage
> by a percent up to a cap. Small chance that when taking a hit, instead
> becomes a block, can be increased by Attribute Mastery.
>
> Footwork – Can only be increased via items worn, increases the damage
> you take when hit, but also increases your chance to change the
> initiative and become on the offence. Small chance when parrying to
> also strike the enemy. Increased by Attribute Mastery.
>
> Attribute Mastery
>
> When you reach the Mastery Level Mark Here of an attribute, you unlock
> the mastery of that skill. This (and Mastercraft Items) are the only
> way to improve the secondary Feature of that attribute. You may
> continue to level these attributes, but attribute mastery is only
> reached once.

Weapon Groups:

> To define how a user will play, there will be 4 unique weapon groups,
> which are all on the variation of the main playstyle, the sword. The
> sword playstyle will determine what counters what, as it is the most
> balanced playstyle. The other 4 playstyles will have strengths that
> are balanced by the weaknesses they lose to make room for those
> strengths.

Skill Combo’s For Sword, the Base Weapon Group

> Each Response is determined by these twenty five results, and each
> result has an animation. Weapon playstyle will change these results to
> change gameplay.

|         | DEF - Q | DEF - W | DEF - E | DEF - R | DEF - SPC|
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|ATK - Q|Perfect Block|Correct Block|Light Hit|Solid Hit|Critical Strike|
|ATK - W|Critical Strike|Perfect Block|Correct Block|Light Hit|Solid Hit|
|ATK - E|Solid Hit|Critical Strike|Perfect Block|Correct Block|Light Hit|
|ATK - R|Light Hit|Solid Hit|Critical Strike|Perfect Block|Correct Block|
|ATK - Spc|Correct Block|Light Hit|Solid Hit|Critical Strike|Perfect Block|

Perfect Block: No damage taken, turn the initiative.

Correct Block: No damage taken, chance based on skill to turn the initiative.

Light Hit: Half base damage dealt.

Solid Hit: Full base damage dealt.

Critical Strike: 1.5 base damage dealt, chance based on strength to mutilate.


Sword Playstyle:

> The basic Playstyle pattern
>
> Perfect Block
>
> Correct Block
> 
> Light Hit
>
> Solid Hit
> 
> Critical Strike

Axe Playstyle:

> The Axe Playstyle modifies all hits into solid hits, at the detriment
> of losing the ability to critically strike as well as Perfect Block.
> This gives the axe player a steadier range of attacks, but less
> ability to seize back the initiative.
>
> Therefore: Light hits become Solid hits, Critical hits become solid
> hits when the axe is the attacker. All Basic Axe weapons add a chance
> to mutilate as axe’s need to hack, and all perfect blocks become
> correct blocks.

Spear Playstyle:

> The Spear playstyle is based upon being an offensive item. This
> ability changes the correct block of the opponent to a light hit
> result, but also changes the correct block of its own user as well as
> the solid hit to a light hit result. This mimics the spears inability
> to do massive damage and their inability to defend unless flawless,
> but emphasizes its ability to find holes in the enemy defence. Axes
> cannot defend against the spear as they can only correctly block, so
> an Axe user must find other means to turn the initiative against spear
> users, which will give them the upper hand.
>
> Therefore: Solid hits become Light hits when the spear is the
> attacker, correct blocks become light hits for both attackers.
>
> Two Handed Playstyle:
>
> The two handed playstyle is an all-out offensive playstyle. All solid
> hits that are landed on the enemy are turned into critical Strikes,
> but the correct block and light hit option instead become Perfect
> Block and correct blocks respectively.
>
> Therefore: When the Two handed player is attacking, Correct blocks
> become Perfect Blocks THEN Light hits become Correct blocks, Solid
> hits become Critical Strikes

Fencing or BACK AND FORTH combat style:

> One Character is on offence and one character is on defence. This
> stays constant until the Offence Defence is switched. This switch
> occurs when either the character is backed up to a wall (edge of
> stage) or when they achieve an INITIATIVE SWITCH which some
> combination of user and enemy input can create (as well as some items
> may modify other skill combinations to create.) This switch will be
> denoted by a shift in the skills one can use and a symbol in the top
> corner denoting what you should be doing.

Timing Window:

> This is quite important because it is the window in which a user has
> to put in their command to fight. If a user misses this window they
> are unable to react at all. This feature is scaled off of a characters
> own Reaction time as well as the attackers Speed Stat. The Faster the
> speed stat, the smaller the Window, the higher the reaction stat, the
> Larger the time to react. Equal stats will net in the default reaction
> window, which should be whatever feels most reasonable. Numbers will
> be played around with. The timing window is not unique to a player
> (not everyone has their own window) but rather is based on the
> combined stats of the duelists.

Attack Window:

> The window in which the user has to attack, if this window is missed,
> the user gives up initiative and the opponent will be on the offensive
> instead. This window gets smaller with the attackers speed, making it
> harder to trip up, but increasing the offensive capabilities by
> shrinking the overall time the opponent has to react.

Overworld

> Precombat overworld is a top down RPG, with either a SQUARE base of
> movement or a HEX base. You interact much like a pokemon game. Upon
> interacting with a trigger the game will switch to combat, where your
> part members will be spread out. You will have the ability to set the
> starting position of your troops in camp, but they will follow a
> generic starting positon if that formation is not set. Once in combat
> your will have a turn order based Characters Initiative stats, and
> movement ranges based on their speed stats. You will have to select
> your unit, your unit can move X amount of steps based on their turn.
> Interacting with an opponent will trigger that fight between units.
> Fight ends when one unit is out of constitution. That if that unit has
> been mutilated, but did not reach 0 constitution, the fight ends, and
> the unit is no longer able to battle, but they are not dead for good,
> they will be mutilated for good, and will face a stat reduction based
> on the mutilation roll.

Very similar to Diablo (above) pretty generic RPG based system

Party screen will be able to modify each user’s inventory, as well as
their equipment, and check their stats. Level up screen will be in the
stats, when a level up for a user is available, the user can level them
up in the stats screen.

WEAPON ITEMS
> Weapon Class (WC) - Value to determine the weapon quality (base and scaling) as well as what enemies drop it.
> 
> Weapon Playstyle (WP) - Determines the playstyle of the weapon
> 
> Damage - WC base damage range + (WC scaling damage range x primary Attribute) 
> 
> Magic Property - Case by case scenario, will have to builds unique cases for each magic weapon that can alter playstyle or stats.

> Stat boosts
